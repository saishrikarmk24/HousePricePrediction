House Price Prediction (Beginner Project)

This is a beginner-level machine learning project where I use **Linear Regression** to predict housing prices based on features like area, bedrooms, parking, and more.

## ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“ˆ Accuracy
Achieved ~65% accuracy using basic Linear Regression.

## ðŸ§  Goal
I'm currently learning machine learning and this is one of my first projects. I plan to improve this model by experimenting with better algorithms like Random Forest, and adding new evaluation metrics.
